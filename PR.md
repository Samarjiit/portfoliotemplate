# PR Tasks and Questions

Here are some questions I am suggesting for PR :

1) What does Public Relation mean to you?
2) How can you use social media to reach more audience?
3) How can you convince a sponsor for a sponsorship for our event?
4) Why should we take you in our PR team, I mean how you can be a better candidate than the other person who would have applied for this?
5) If you are a member of PR, then you should have good convincing abilities. Think of me as a potential sponsor for your society events and try to convince me for the same.
6) How many likes and shares can we expect from you on our event posts?
